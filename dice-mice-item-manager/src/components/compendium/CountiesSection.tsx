            When creating a new house, you&apos;ll select one of these counties as your origin.
            Characters from your house will benefit from rolling 3d4 keep 3 for the county&apos;s associated stat,
            giving them an advantage in that attribute during character creation.

            Additionally, once per adventure a mouse from a given region can reroll a single check from one of the associated checks.  Once you have rerolled using this feature, you cannot reroll any other associated check with that feature that adventure.
